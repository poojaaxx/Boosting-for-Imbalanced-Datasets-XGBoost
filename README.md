# Boosting for Imbalanced Datasets with XGBoost

This project focuses on handling imbalanced classification problems using boosting techniques.
XGBoost is used as the primary model to improve classification performance on minority classes.

## Project Overview
Imbalanced datasets pose challenges for traditional machine learning algorithms.
This project applies XGBoost along with class imbalance handling techniques such as SMOTE
and weighted loss functions to address this issue.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis to understand class imbalance
- Baseline statistical and machine learning model
- Advanced boosting using XGBoost
- Class imbalance handling using SMOTE
- Performance evaluation using Precision-Recall and ROC-AUC metrics
- Natural Language Processing using TF-IDF for text features

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
